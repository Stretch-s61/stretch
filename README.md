Stretch is a Google Chrome extension that reminds users to stretch occasionally. Options allow the user to enable/disable the application and set the timing and frequency of reminders. Exercises are taken from the Physera API.

Progress:
- Working Version 1: notification page, storage for exercise.json, fix schedule for notifications, update aesthetics for popup.html and options.html and notifications.html, options page, alarms reset, toggle on/off button, making sure that options fully work, need to test options from 9-5 and make sure they turn off post 5 pm, make sure that when we change options, the alarms get reset, testing
- Working Version 2: removed options page, replaced options page with frequency button, don't open new tabs when Chrome is off, make window active when using chrome.tab.updates, bootstrapped, different types of exercises (wrist, back/neck, all), ensure popup.html closes, create a fixed size for notification.html
