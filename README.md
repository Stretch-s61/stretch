#### What is Stretch?
- Stretch is a Google Chrome extension that reminds users to stretch every 30, 60, or 120 minutes with office-friendly exercises taken from the Physera API. Options allow the user to enable/disable the application, set the frequency of reminders, and change what area of the body the exercises target.
