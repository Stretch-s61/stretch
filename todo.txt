done - fix the display on the notification page
in progress- storage for exercise.json? rather than fetching from the website every time
-- if exercise.json is not too old (how to check)? use it
-- otherwise, fetch from website and update exercise.json
- look into eslint to help format things
- lodash library
- fix schedule for notifications (on the hour, 9-5?) 
-- need to have fields where users can input what they want -> storage
